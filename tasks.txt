Implicit Wait - wait by time

Explicit Wait - wait until something append ,need to set max time of waiting:

Exam-

// click on the compose button as soon as the "compose" button is visible
driver.findElement(By.xpath("//div[contains(text(),'COMPOSE')]")).click();

Fluent Wait -no limit time of respond, also u can write fex commands into:

Exam-
Wait wait = new FluentWait(WebDriver reference)
.withTimeout(timeout, SECONDS)
.pollingEvery(timeout, SECONDS)
.ignoring(Exception.class);

WebElement foo=wait.until(new Function<WebDriver, WebElement>() {
public WebElement applyy(WebDriver driver) {
return driver.findElement(By.id("foo"));
}
});

Big one:
put machine learning to the action:"respong back text message", and learn from the last responds what to send back 
finally do it for many contacts.
